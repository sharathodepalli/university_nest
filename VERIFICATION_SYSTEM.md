## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

#### User Type Updates:

```typescript
export interface User {
  // ... existing fields
  verified: boolean;
  verificationStatus?: "unverified" | "pending" | "verified" | "rejected";
  verificationMethod?: "email" | "document" | "admin";
  verifiedAt?: Date;
}
```

#### Verification Request:

```typescript
interface VerificationRequest {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  method: VerificationMethod;
  status: VerificationStatus;
  submittedAt: Date;
  reviewedAt?: Date;
  documents?: string[];
  universityEmail?: string;
  rejectionReason?: string;
  adminNotes?: string;
}
```

### Storage

- **Development**: localStorage with key `verification_request_${userId}`
- **Production**: Supabase database table `verification_requests`
- **Documents**: Secure file storage (Supabase Storage or AWS S3)

### API Endpoints (Future)

```typescript
// Verification endpoints
