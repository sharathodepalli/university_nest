# Privacy Settings Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Privacy Hook (`usePrivacy.ts`)

- Centralized privacy settings management
- Automatic loading/saving to localStorage
- Privacy check functions for different scenarios
- Filtered user data based on privacy settings

### 2. Privacy Settings Page

- Updated to use the centralized privacy hook
- Settings are automatically saved when changed
- Real-time application of privacy controls

### 3. Profile Page Privacy Controls

- **Email visibility**: Hidden with message when privacy setting is disabled
- **Phone visibility**: Hidden with message when privacy setting is disabled
- Privacy settings are applied immediately

### 4. Listing Detail Page Privacy Controls

- **Contact modal**: Respects host's email and phone privacy settings
- **Message button**: Disabled if host doesn't allow messages from current user
- **Message permissions**: Based on host's `allowMessages` setting (everyone/verified/none)
- **Visual feedback**: Shows why messaging is disabled

### 5. Privacy Settings Available

- `profileVisibility`: public/university/private
- `showEmail`: Show/hide email address
- `showPhone`: Show/hide phone number
- `allowMessages`: everyone/verified users only/none
- `showOnline`: Show/hide online status (ready for future implementation)
- `dataSharing`: Allow/disallow data sharing
- `marketingEmails`: Allow/disallow marketing emails
- `pushNotifications`: Enable/disable push notifications

## How It Works

1. **User A** sets their privacy preferences in Profile → Privacy Settings
2. **User B** views User A's profile or listing:
   - If User A has `showEmail: false`, email shows "Email hidden by privacy settings"
   - If User A has `showPhone: false`, phone shows "Phone hidden by privacy settings"
   - If User A has `allowMessages: 'verified'` and User B is not verified, message button is disabled
   - If User A has `allowMessages: 'none'`, messaging is completely disabled

## Real-World Testing

To test the privacy settings:

1. **Set up two user accounts** (or test with current user)
2. **Go to Profile → Privacy Settings**
3. **Turn off "Show Email" and "Show Phone"**
4. **Save settings**
5. **View your profile** - email and phone should show as hidden
6. **Create a listing and have another user view it**
7. **Check contact modal** - email/phone should be hidden
8. **Set "Allow Messages" to "Verified users only"**
9. **Test messaging as unverified user** - button should be disabled

## Data Storage

- Privacy settings are stored in `localStorage` with key `privacy_settings_${userId}`
- Settings persist across browser sessions
- Default privacy-safe settings are applied if no stored settings exist

## Privacy Enforcement Points

1. **Profile display** (ProfilePage.tsx)
2. **Contact information modal** (ListingDetailPage.tsx)
3. **Message initiation** (ListingDetailPage.tsx)
4. **Future: User search/discovery** (can be added to BrowsePage)
5. **Future: Real-time messaging** (can check online status privacy)

The privacy settings are now **actually functional** and control what information is displayed throughout the application!
